This repository is full of various code samples.

## bootstrap.sh
This file serves as the key component of a Vagrant-based DevOps provisioning process for Drupal 7 development. Please take a look at the "main" section of the script at the bottom of the file. This code sample highlights how I like to structure my code in a readable way.

## esrifield
This sample demonstrates some of my PHP programming within the broader Drupal framework to define custom field types for Drupal's field API, utilizing dyanmic form loading for the configuration of said field. esrifield is designed to be used with ESRI's ArcGIS server, particularly their REST endpoints. It allows the selection of data elements within an ArcGIS endpoint to be selected from within Drupal and supports rendering those data elements within Drupal.
